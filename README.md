# Railway-system-using-graphs

Based on the train routes from the files, the application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between nodes of the graph that simulates the railway system of Romania. 
The application also implemets certain tasks such as finding the shortest/longest distance between stations, finding the furthest station from Bucharest, finding the distance between certain stations.
